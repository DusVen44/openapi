      title: Task Definition
      required:
        - isEnabled
        - cronExpression
        - taskType
      properties:
        isEnabled:

            The cron job runs in UTC time and is in Unix cron format. (See the Cron Expression Validator Script.)
            Only one of ‘frequency' or ‘cronExpression' can be used at a time.

          type: string
          example: clusterRoll
          description: >
            The activity that you are scheduling. Valid values: "clusterRoll". Required for cluster.scheduling.tasks.

        type: array

  summary: "Initiate Roll"
  description: >
    Roll an entire Ocean cluster or roll subsets of the cluster by specifying launchSpecIds or instanceIds. Performing this request will start the roll immediately and run it in defined batches.

    Note that the first response for a successful request will indicate the start of a roll. In order to check the status of a roll, you can use the GET Roll API.

                   When set to True and virtual node group identifiers are defined to roll, the specified launch spec(s) will be blocked from scaling up. (Replacements will scale up in other launch specs that match the displaced pods instead.) This is meant for different use cases of 'migrating' nodes from one launch spec to another.

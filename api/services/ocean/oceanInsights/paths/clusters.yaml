    Prerequisite:

    Kubenet-based AKS clusters only: The permissions needed in the Azure managed service identity (MSI) for Ocean to use when provisioning new nodes should be adjusted. Run the displayed script on a workstation with an Owner permissions token for the Azure environment. [Learn more](https://docs.spot.io/ocean/getting-started/aks?id=additional-steps-for-kubenet-based-clusters).

    Notes:

    1. The Ocean Controller is used to monitor the cluster resources and report back to Ocean SaaS. A properly functioning controller is mandatory for Ocean to operate. To install the Controller, run the following script on a machine with kubectl command line tool installed and configured:

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    curl -fsSL http://spotinst-public.s3.amazonaws.com/integrations/kubernetes/cluster-controller/scripts/init.sh | \
    SPOTINST_TOKEN=<ENTER YOUR TOKEN HERE> \
    SPOTINST_ACCOUNT=<ENTER YOUR SPOTINST ACCOUNT ID HERE> \
    SPOTINST_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER=<ENTER YOUR CLUSTER IDENTIFIER HERE> \
    bash
    ```
